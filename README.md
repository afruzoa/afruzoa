#About Me üë©‚Äçüíª
I am a passionate software engineer with a deep interest in data engineering and artificial intelligence. I specialize in building scalable applications using technologies like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js. While my core expertise lies in software engineering, I‚Äôm also fascinated by how data can drive innovation and how AI can transform industries.I strive to bridge the gap between software engineering and data science, creating solutions that not only optimize performance but also unlock valuable insights from complex data. My ultimate goal is to harness the power of AI and data to develop smart, scalable systems that can drive technological advancement and solve real-world challenges.
#What I do üíª
I focus on building efficient and scalable software systems while continuously improving my skills in data engineering and AI. I‚Äôm always looking to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects.
#List of my projects üìë
1. Task Management Web App
A full-stack application where users can create, manage, and track tasks. You could implement features like user authentication, task prioritization, and due date reminders using Node.js, Express.js, and a database (MongoDB).

2. Real-Time Chat Application
Develop a real-time chat application with socket.io and Node.js. Add features like direct messaging, group chat, notifications, and media sharing.

3. Personal Portfolio Website
Build a dynamic portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express.js. Include sections for your projects, blogs, resume, and contact information. You could also make it a single-page application (SPA) using React or Vue.js.

4. Weather Forecast App
Create a weather forecasting app that fetches real-time weather data using an API. Display data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., in a user-friendly interface. You could use React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

5. AI Chatbot
Build an AI-powered chatbot using Python and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The chatbot can answer user queries, hold conversations, or even integrate with APIs like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.

6. Data Pipeline for Social Media Data
Create a data engineering project that extracts data from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter or Instagram) using their APIs, processes the data (e.g., sentiment analysis), and stores it in a database for later analysis.

7. Movie Recommendation System
Develop a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or content-based methods to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. You could implement this in Python with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow.

8. Image Recognition App
Create an app that allows users to upload images, and the app classifies the image into different categories using an image recognition model (e.g., using TensorFlow or OpenCV).

9. Data Visualization Dashboard
Build an interactive data dashboard using JavaScript (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js) to visualize data. This could involve displaying analytics for datasets like stock market trends, health data, or population growth.

10. Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis
Build a machine learning model that predicts outcomes, such as predicting house prices based on various factors. Use Python with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
